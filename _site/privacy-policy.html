     <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Ura, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason).</li>
     <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products or protect our rights.</li>
     <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>
     <li>In our platform, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals. (Note: this privacy policy available under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and we’d appreciate a link to Automattic.com, which is the organisation that created this document first).</p>

     <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="mailto:team@ura.design">support team</a>.<br />
       It is Ura’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our platform.</p>

     <p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>

<p>Like most website operators, Ura collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ura’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ura’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Ura may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br />
Ura also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Ura only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

     <p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>

<p>Certain visitors to Ura’s websites choose to interact with Ura in ways that require the Ura team to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ura gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who wish to donate to provide some personal information. Those who engage in financial transactions related to the Ura project – by purchasing a software as a services package, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Ura collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Ura. The Ura team does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

     <p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></p>
     <p>Ura may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Ura may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Ura does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

     <p><strong>Information We Collect from Other Sources</strong></p>
     <p>With your authorization, we may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your Ura account through a a Github account we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information etc) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>

     <p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
     <p>Ura discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ura’s behalf or to provide services available at Ura’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ura’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ura will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ura discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ura believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ura, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Ura website and have supplied your email address, Ura may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ura and our services. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request, we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ura takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

     <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
     <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ura uses cookies to help Ura identify and track visitors, their usage of Ura website, and their website access preferences. Ura visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Ura’s website(s), with the drawback that certain features of Ura’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

     <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
     <p>If Ura, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Ura goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Ura may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

      <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Ura may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Ura’s sole discretion. Ura encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

     <p>Change log:</p>
