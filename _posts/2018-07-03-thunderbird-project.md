Our journey to the open source design world continues with our involvement on the Thunderbird project. One of the reasons we love helping communities that create and support open source projects is the direct and explicit communication we have with those folks. They are always there to answer our questions and give feedback during the entire creative process, just like we did with the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) community on their Mailing List and through IRC meetings for quite a few months. Now, we have the Thunderbird community which [reached out on Github](https://github.com/thundernest/thunderbird-website/issues/22) at first for a creative "404" page for their website and this is where we got in.

## Logo redesign 
Quite a few months ago designers involed on the Thunderbird project filed a new [issue on Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1404648) and started discussing for a possibly redesigned logo for the e-mail client software. Elio Qoshi, Ura's creative leader and founder, as part of the greater Mozilla community got into the discussion and together with the community they came up with a revamped logo. The continious consultation among the community members and Ryan Sipes, Thunderbird's Community Manager, resauleted on a remodeled logo which was included on the Thunderbird 60 release.

## Usability research
For quite some time now we offer Usability Research services as we are collaborating with Renata Gegaj, our Usability Research expert. Thunderbird was the first project Renata was involed in as part of the Ura team as she conducted a full usability study on real users. During [Open Source Conferense Albania (OSCAL)](https://osc.al) 2018, Renata selected 6 people of different ages and occupations and assigned them 9 tasks to complete while using the software. While users would do so, she observed wheather they encountered any blockers and noted them down in order to prepare a full report for the Thunderbird Legal Council which will help the project's developers and designers to improve their users' experience with the software in the future.

## Styleguide
We strongly support the idea that organizations and communities should have their brand mediums in one corner placed carefully, that's why we came up with the initial idea of [Identihub](https://identihub.co) ,our first software. Although, styleguides are a different type of having your brands' visual details in one place. As we've done in the past for the [Tor Project](https://styleguide.torproject.org) and [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/style), for Thunderbird we developed a full [styleguide](https://ura.design/projects/thunderbird) for them based on [Firefox's structure](https://design.firefox.com), keeping the Mozilla vibe. There you can find all the details regarding Thunderbird's logo like colors, typography, icons and license.

## New website
Furthermore, we [decided to help](https://github.com/thundernest/thunderbird-website/issues/31) Thunderbird by redesigning their website following clear guidelines. This is still underway and you can check our progress on the issue linked above.
